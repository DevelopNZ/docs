In the land of New Zealand, where software developers dwell

They gather on Slack, where their conversations they tell

They share their thoughts and ideas, discuss the latest trends

And work together to build great software that never ends

They are a clever bunch, with knowledge that is deep

They know their languages well, from Python to Java to C++

They write code thatâ€™s efficient, with algorithms that are sound

And debug their programs with precision, until no errors are found

Their work is never done, as they constantly strive

To improve their skills and learn new technologies that thrive

For they know that in this field, the pace is always fast

And to stay ahead, they must be willing to work hard and be steadfast

So to all the software developers on Slack in New Zealand

I salute you and your dedication, your passion and your zeal

You are the ones who keep our world moving forward

With your brilliant minds and your love for all things computer.
